## FaceDrop Project, full paper facedrop.pdf

FaceDrop' goal is to create a new approach that allows users to have secure storage and sharing over untrusted cloud providers. The general idea of the proposal is to use separate channels for the authentication and for data exchange. Authentication and key establishment can be done using any popular social media which provides private messaging. 

Once the shared key established among different parties involved in the sharing, data is transferred using a different channel encrypted using the above-mentioned key. Data channel can be any cloud storage provider or providers. The key idea behind FaceBox is, by reducing the visibility of a given provider towards the shared data the data owner can leave minimum trust on each provider and can still use to share data securely. 

Main contributions of the FaceDrop are, a) to provide secure file sharing among trusted parties over minimally trusted cloud service providers and b) to securely consolidate available data space over different cloud service providers.
